# TMDB-Boxoffice-Prediction
The objective of the project was to determine the revenue of a movie before its release based on certain features of the movie.
80% of the features were text and that was the most challenging part of the project. I have to analyzed and interpret the text features, so that i can convert them into numerical features.
